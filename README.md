## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jack Kelly

Since about 2008 I've been trying to help reduce COâ‚‚ emissions enough that the climate _actually notices_. This turns out to be surprisingly tricky!

Between about 2017 to 2023 I applied machine learning to energy forecasting. But weather forecast datasets are hard to work with because they tend to consist of petabytes of legacy file formats (like GRIB)! So, starting in 2024, my new obsession is building tools (in Rust and Python) to help make it easier to work with petabytes of GRIB data in cloud object storage. My current project in this vain is [`hypergrib`](https://github.com/JackKelly/hypergrib).

The "dream" is that anyone with a laptop and an Internet connection and a little knowledge of machine learning should be able to train and run a state-of-the-art energy forecast (by lazilly loading lots of different weather forecasts). We're a long way from this "dream" right now! Please see [this blog post for more info on this idea](https://openclimatefix.org/post/lazy-loading-making-it-easier-to-access-vast-datasets-of-weather-satellite-data).

I'm co-founder of [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix/) (a non-profit).
