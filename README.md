## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jack Kelly

Since about 2008 I've been working on reducing COâ‚‚ emissions enough that the climate _actually notices_. I'm co-founder of [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix/) (a non-profit).

My main interest at the moment is to enable anyone with a laptop, an Internet connection, and a little knowledge of machine learning to train and run state-of-the-art energy forecasts (by lazily loading historical and live gridded weather forecasts from multiple weather forecast providers). See [this repo](https://github.com/JackKelly/lets_make_it_super_easy_to_use_weather_forecast_data) for more info.
