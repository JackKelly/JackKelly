## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jack Kelly

I'm a computer programmer. Since 2008 I've been working on trying to reduce COâ‚‚ emissions enough that the climate _actually notices_. I'm co-founder of [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix/).

My main interest at the moment is to make it super-easy to train and run state-of-the-art energy forecasts. See [this repo](https://github.com/JackKelly/lets_make_it_super_easy_to_use_weather_forecast_data) for more info.
