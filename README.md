## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jack Kelly

Since about 2008 I've been working on reducing COâ‚‚ emissions enough that the climate _actually notices_. I'm co-founder of [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix/) (a non-profit).

My main interest at the moment is to enable anyone with a laptop, an Internet connection, and a little knowledge of machine learning to train and run a state-of-the-art energy forecast (by lazily loading historical and live gridded weather forecasts from multiple weather forecast providers). We're a long way from this "dream" right now! But we're getting there! Please see [this blog post for more info on this idea](https://openclimatefix.org/post/lazy-loading-making-it-easier-to-access-vast-datasets-of-weather-satellite-data).

This should have a number of use-cases and benefits:
- Academics and students can easily experiment with energy forecasting (using realistic datasets).
- We can _finally_ build a public leaderboard of different energy forecasting algorithms, measured against a standard validation dataset (again, using the types of huge datasets that are used in industry, rather than toy academic datasets).
- Maybe we could run a simple and cheap energy forecasting service with state-of-the-art performance.

My current project in this vain is [`hypergrib`](https://github.com/JackKelly/hypergrib).

Once `hypergrib` is up-and-running, I'm planning to return to researching ML algorithms for energy forecasting, and continuing to build open-source tools for energy forecasting.
